# An Introduction to Semidefinite Programming for Combinatorial Optimization

Tutorial given by [Samuel
Burer](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/people/samuel-a-burer) at the Summer
School of the [20th Conference on Integer Programming and Combinatorial
Optimization](http://umich.edu/~ipco2019conf/index.html).

*Abstract:* Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a powerful modeling
technique that extends both linear and second-order cone programming.
In this tutorial, we discuss the basics of SDP, including applications,
duality, algorithms, and software. We'll also cover various SDP
relaxation techniques for combinatorial optimization problems such as
MaxCut and maxiumum stable set, which are classical "success stories"
in this area. Finally, we'll explore the boundary of current research,
especially in the area of mixed-integer nonlinear programming.
